Description: Manage your logs in the dark and have lasers going and make it look like you're from space.
 Graylog2 enables you to unleash the power that lays inside your logs. Use it to run analytics, alerting,
 monitoring and powerful searches over your whole log base. Need to debug a failing request? Just run
 a quick filter search to find it and see what errors it produced. Want to see all messages a certain API
 consumer is consuming in real time? Create streams for every consumer and have them always only one click
 away.
